Java 111 Extra Challenge - Unit Testing

Your goal is to write unit tests to prove the following classes work correctly. 

1. SubStringPractice. Write your unit tests in TestSubStringPractice. (.5 point)
2. NumberChallenge1. Write your unit tests in TestNumberChallenge1. (1 point)
3. NumberChallenge2. Fix NumberChallenge2 so that it works according to the method comments. Write your unit tests in TestNumberChallenge2. (1.5 points)
4. NumberChallenge3. Complete NumberChallenge3 so that it works according to the method comments. Write your unit tests in TestNumberChallenge3. (2 points)


Tips: 

1. In each class, examples are provided of the expected output given certain input. AT MINIMUM, your unit tests must successfully test each of these cases. You should have one code block per "case", do not roll all test cases into a single code block or if/else check!
2. Look for // TODO comments in the classes to guide your work.
3. TestGreeting is provided as an example of unit testing the Greeting class.


To submit your work for feedback, zip up your completed java111EC directory and send it to your instructor (by Slack) along with screenshots
of the output from each of your completed test classes.
