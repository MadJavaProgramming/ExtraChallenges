Java 111 Extra Credit - Unit Testing - Possible Points: 5

Your goal is to write unit tests to prove the following classes work correctly. 

1. SubStringPractice. Write your unit tests in TestSubStringPractice. (.5 point)
2. NumberChallenge1. Write your unit tests in TestNumberChallenge1. (1 point)
3. NumberChallenge2. Fix NumberChallenge2 so that it works according to the method comments. Write your unit tests in TestNumberChallenge2. (1.5 points)
4. NumberChallenge3. Complete NumberChallenge3 so that it works according to the method comments. Write your unit tests in TestNumberChallenge3. (2 points)


Tips: 

1. In each class, examples are provided of the expected output given certain input. AT MINIMUM, your unit tests must successfully test each of these cases to receive
	full credit for testing that class. You should have one method per "case", do not roll all test cases into a single method!
2. Look for // TODO comments in the classes to guide your work.
3. TestGreeting is provided as an example of unit testing the Greeting class.


This extra credit exercise should be treated as project work: it should be completed independently.

To submit your work for grading, zip up your completed java111EC directory and send it to your instructor (by Slack or Email) along with screenshots
of the output from each of your completed test classes.

This extra credit exercise will be accepted until July 31, 2019 at 11:59 p.m.
