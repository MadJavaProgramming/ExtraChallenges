# Week 5 Method Practice

1. Copy MethodPractice.java and MethodPracticeTestDrive.java to your labs directory.
2. Do not make any changes yet! 
2. Read through the comments in MethodPractice.java to understand what is provided and what you'll be doing in this practice exercise.
3. Read through the comments in MethodPracticeTestDrive.java.
4. Run MethodPracticeTestDrive. It should run as is and will demonstrate one completed method.
5. Complete the TODOs in both MethodPractice and MethodPracticeTestDrive. 

**Tip** Compile and run often so that you don't end up with large blocks of code to debug!
